## Troubleshooting
> This app uses the ytdl-core, yt-search, ytpl, spotify-web-api-node and the spotify-url-info package to stream from the music from youtube and spotify, which is frequently updated as it makes changes. If your bot has issues streaming a particular music, try again later or check for an updated version of the dependency.

## NOTE
Make sure you give your Music bot the Admin role as it will need to destroy messages that are not music links.
